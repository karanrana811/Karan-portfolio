This is my journey through Neog's LevelZero, wherein I was introduced to programming; I learned HTML5, CSS3, vanillaJS, nodeJS, reactJS and web-hosting through netlify and github. Having understood what a developer mindset is, I believe I can become very proficient in the languages mentioned previously, as long as I continue to practice and learn.
